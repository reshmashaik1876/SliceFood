# SliceFood

Project Name: Slice Food 
Team Name: Marshmallow 
Team Members: Reshma Shaik

SliceFood is an organization that hires employees for both full-time and part-time. It is a corporation providing uniform services to clients in the fields of education, healthcare, business etc. In our Android project, we chose to design an application for all such employees. In this application, people can once register to become a “SliceFood” employee. On the other hand, the already registered employees can access their profiles, view their job schedules, time sheets etc.
